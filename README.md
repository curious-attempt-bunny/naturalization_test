# Naturalization Test

This is for the Citizenship N400 naturalization test. Most test apps are multiple choice which is not the format of the actual test. The actual test is spoken without prompting for possible answers.

# Adaptive

This test will bias towards asking the questions you get wrong.

# Caveats

Some parts of the test depend on your state (this test is setup for Oregon). Some parts of the test vary over time (who's president, vice president, and speaker of the house).
